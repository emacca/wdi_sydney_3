# idea: start with some statement saying its a calculator
# then ask for the first value like say "Enter a value"
# if the response is not an integer say "That's not a valid number! Try again."
# After a valid integer has been entered ask the user 
# "What operation would you like to perform? Addition (a), Subtraction (s), Multiplication (m), Division (d), Power (p), Square root (sq):"
# Then type in code for appropriate operation.
# In all cases other than square root, ask for a second value
# Then display result.
