#Image Carousel App

You will construct an image carousel from the spec provided below.

Make one like the carousel provided by Bootstrap ( http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel) - but you will be building yours from scratch

##Specification:

* We are going to rebuild this from scratch.
* Add event listeners for mouseover and mouseexit to change the opacity of the next and previous buttons.
* Implement the toLeft and toRight functions that will move the margin to display either the next or previous image. 


##### Bonus
* Get the animation working so that the images slide across rather than just appearing

You will need to find a set of images that are roughly the same size to use in your carousel.

The example html assumes you'll have one for London, NYC and SF... you can have whatever you like.


If you missed it before, here are the javascript koans. 
Do these after you get the carousel working - as you can continue to finish them up over the weekend.

Note: Javascript: this != Ruby: self
They are similar in some contexts - but unerstanding the difference will be
essential for you when reading other peoples' code

Javascript Koans (the good bits)

Just like ruby, there are also javascript koans.
You'll want to clone a copy of this github repo and work your way through
these to acheive javascript mastery (and a little bit about testing with the
jasmine library).
